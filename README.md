## 1. About this Project 

This is a project for detecting plagiarism by hashing from Algorithm and Data Structure Course. 
It compares different string matching methods, including regular hashing and rolling hashing, and compares their performances. 

- Time: Spring 2021
- Duration: 2 weeks
- Language: Python
- Techniques: Hash function 

In this project, I apply two algorithms and test them with several cases accompanied by time complexity analysis.


**Algorihtms** 
* Rabin karp rolling hash
* Regular hash 

**Evaluation Criteria** 
* Percentage of plagiarism
* Identify location of plagiarism in texts

**Test Cases** 
*  Basic 
*  Find and replace plagiarism
*  Mashup plagiarism

**Time Complexity Analysis** 
*  Compare algorithms
*  Compare different hash table sizes


The output of the the percentage of plagiarism for two texts and the location where plagiarism occurs.
